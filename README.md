# Drowsiness_Detection

Drowsiness detection is implemented to provide visual warnings as a safety measure. It utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze facial expressions, eye movements, and other visual cues indicative of drowsiness. When signs of drowsiness are detected in real-time video streams, the system triggers visual warnings displayed directly to the operator, typically through dashboard displays or heads-up displays. These warnings serve as immediate alerts, prompting the operator to take corrective actions to maintain alertness and prevent potential accidents. By leveraging visual cues and providing real-time feedback, the system enhances safety in contexts such as transportation and workplace environments, where visual warnings are effective in capturing the operator's attention and prompting timely responses to mitigate the risks associated with drowsy operation.
